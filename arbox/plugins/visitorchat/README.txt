== Description ==
ClientEngage VisitorChat for WordPress is a fully-featured real-time chat 
solution for your WordPress blog or website. And best of all: it comes with a 
native Windows-based client right out-of-the-box so you can start chatting from 
the comfort of your desktop.

== Installation ==
If you are using WordPress in a single-site environment, simply use the plugin 
installer and activate it afterwards.
However, if you are using WordPress as a network and have multiple sites, please 
first install the plugin using the network manager. Afterwards, do *not* 
network-activate the plugin. Instead, activate it separately on each of your 
sites.
