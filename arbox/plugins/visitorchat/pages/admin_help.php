                    <h4>Understanding Opt-In and Opt-Out</h4>
                    <p>The default setting is <strong>Opt-Out</strong>. This means that VisitorChat will always be shown, unless you specifically hide the chat through individual posts'/pages' meta-settings.</p>
                    <p>You can also choose <strong>Opt-In</strong>. This means that VisitorChat will only be shown if you specifically decide to do so by using individual posts'/pages' meta-settings. </p>

                    <hr />

                    <h4>Toggling VisitorChat on individual posts & pages</h4>
                    <p>If you wish to show or hide VisitorChat on individual posts or pages, simply "edit" the page and perform your settings in the "VisitorChat Meta-Box".</p>

                    <hr />

                    <h4>VisitorChat ShortCodes</h4>
                    <p>You can use the VisitorChat shortcodes to conditionally display content according to whether your chat's status is offline, or online:</p>
                    <p>[visitorchat status="online"]This content is shown if the chat is online.[/visitorchat]</p>
                    <p>[visitorchat status="offline"]This content is shown if the chat is offline.[/visitorchat]</p>

                    <hr />

                    <h4>Executing code when VisitorChat is loaded</h4>
                    <p>Simply paste the code below into one of your script-tags and insert your code within the function's body - it will be executed once VisitorChat is fully initialised:</p>
                    <pre>
    var CEVC_Onload = function() {
        // your code goes here
    };
                    </pre>
                    <hr />

                    <h4>Programmatically opening VisitorChat</h4>
                    <p>Simply paste the code below into one of your script-tags (the event will only be attached once VisitorChat is loaded):</p>
                    <pre>
    var CEVC_Onload = function() {
        $(".btnOpenChat").on("click", function(e){
             e.preventDefault();
             if(!$(".vc_chat_container").hasClass(".vc_box_open"))
             {
                $(".vc_chat_head").trigger("click");
             }
        });
    };
                    </pre>
                    <p>And use a hyperlink such as the following to trigger the action:</p>
                    <pre>
    &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;btnOpenChat&quot;&gt;Open Chat&lt;/a&gt;
